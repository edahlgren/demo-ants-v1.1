# Using an artificial ant colony for data mining

Ants are decentralized, and have limited memory and capabilities. Yet through simple communication mechanisms, a colony of ants can efficiently solve complex problems like predator evasion and path finding. When we mimic the behavior of ant colonies in computer systems, we can create efficient, scalable, and distributed algorithms [[1]](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10994-010-5216-5.pdf).

This demo simulates a real ant colony's behavior to extract classification rules from data [[2]](https://sourceforge.net/projects/myra). For example:

+ IF milk = true THEN mammal
+ IF feathers = true THEN bird

Even though neural networks are a very popular way of classifying data, the classifiers they generate tend to be incomprehensible to humans. This opacity makes it very hard for humans to debug, regulate, and trust the models generated by a neural network. In contrast, this approach infers transparent and comprehensible rules that can be validated by experts and non-experts alike [[3]](http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/MasterOpt/Martens&al2007.pdf).

To test the demo, four datasets are included. You can use them to:

+ Predict the class of an animal based on its physical features
+ Predict the species of an iris using its petal and sepal shape
+ Predict the quality of a car based on its features
+ Predict the presence of diabetes in Pima Indian women based on risk factors

The demo defaults to using the AntMiner algorithm created by Rafael Parpinelli, Heitor Lopes, and Alex Freitas [[4]](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1dda/f3c02774f56dba35334c48fbc62f19b9cc14.pdf), but 5 other algorithms are also included for you to experiment with.
