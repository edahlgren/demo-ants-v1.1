# What does this demo do? (1 sentence)

Simulates a real ant colony's foraging behavior to search for the shortest tour of connected points.

or cities in a country. 

# What makes it novel/interesting? (1-3 sentences)

Ants are decentralized, and have limited memory and capabilities. Yet through simple communication mechanisms, a colony of ants can efficiently solve complex problems like predator evasion and shortest path finding.

If we mimic the behavior of ant colonies in computer systems, we can create efficient, scalable, and distributed algorithms for searching through data.

# What can I do with the demo?

You can experiment with a simulated ant colony to find solutions to the traveling salesman problem: find the shortest route a salesman should take to tour a region so he visits every city.

# Why would that be interesting to me?

The traveling salesman problem is an example of an important general problem: how to efficiently make a complete tour of a network. For example, the problem can be used to efficiently route internet data, schedule package deliveries, manage warehouse operations, and even to analyze genetically inherited DNA markers in plants.

# OK, How do I actually do this?

To test the demo, three real-life datasets are included: the coordinates of cities in Djibouti (Africa), Qatar (Middle East), and Luxembourg (Europe). The demo is pre-prepared to run the "MAX-MIN" ant colony system created by Thomas St√ºtzle and Holger H. Hoos, but 5 other algorithms are also included for you to experiment with.
